üçø Cornflix - A Modern UI for Movie Lovers
About The Project
Cornflix is a frontend project that brings a sleek, modern, and intuitive movie browsing experience to life. Designed with a focus on clean aesthetics and user experience, this project demonstrates a responsive layout that looks great on any device, from mobile phones to desktop screens.

The interface presents a rich visual gallery of films and TV shows, organized into familiar, scrollable categories, creating an engaging and seamless browsing experience for the user.

Please note: This is a frontend-only demonstration designed to showcase UI/UX. The movie data is for display purposes only, and there is no backend functionality or actual video streaming.
